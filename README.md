# ARROW DECA Example Design

A simply LED blink design for the Arrow DECA FPGA board.

See my blog post: [The $37 Arrow DECA FPGA Board](http://tomverbeure.github.io/2021/04/23/Arrow-DECA-FPGA-board.html).

Blinks LED 0,1,2.

When KEY0 is pressed (next to the 5V barrel plug), the LEDs blink at double speed.
